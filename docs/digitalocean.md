# DigitalOcean Configuration

To use DigitalOcean as a provider, youâ€™ll first generate a personal access token.

## Steps

1. Login to your DigitalOcean account.
2. Click on [API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api) on the side menu
3. In the Personal access tokens section, click the Generate New Token button. This opens a New personal access token window:
4. Enter a token name, this can be anything, I recommend 'CloudProxy' so you know what it is being used for.
5. Select read and write scopes, write scope is needed so CloudProxy can provision droplets.
6. When you click Generate Token, your token is generated and presented to you on your Personal Access Tokens page. Be sure to record your personal access token. For security purposes, it will not be shown again.

Now you have your token, you can now use DigitalOcean as a proxy provider, on the main page you can see how to set it is an environment variable. 

## Configuration options
### Environment variables: 
#### Required:
`` DIGITALOCEAN_ENABLED`` - to enable DigitalOcean as a provider, set as True. Default value: False

`` DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`` - the token to allow CloudProxy access to your account. 

#### Optional:
``DIGITALOCEAN_MIN_SCALING`` - this is the minimal proxies you required to be provisioned. 
Default value: 2

``DIGITALOCEAN_MAX_SCALING`` - this is currently unused, however will be when autoscaling is implemented. We recommend you set this as the same as the minimum scaling to avoid future issues for now. Default value: 2

``DIGITALOCEAN_SIZE``  - this sets the droplet size, we recommend the smallest droplet as the volume even a small droplet can handle is high. Default value: s-1vcpu-1gb

``DIGITALOCEAN_REGION`` - this sets the region where the droplet is deployed. Some websites may redirect to the language of the country your IP is from. Default value: lon1
